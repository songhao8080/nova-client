    Provides "--strict" option for  "nova host-servers-migrate", "nova host-evacuate",
    "nova host-evacuate-live" and "nova host-meta" commands. When "--strict" option is
    used, the action will be applied to a single compute with the exact hypervisor
    hostname string match rather than to the computes with hostname substring match.
    When the specified hostname does not exist in the system, "NotFound" error code
    will be returned.
