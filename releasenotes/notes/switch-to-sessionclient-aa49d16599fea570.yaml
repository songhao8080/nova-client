    When using novaclient as a library (via novaclient.client.Client
    entry-point), an internal implementation of HTTPClient was used if a
    session object is not specified. For better user experience we switched
    to using SessionClient which uses keystoneauth (Keystone folks maintain
    this library) for all auth stuff.
    The SessionClient interface is similar to HTTPClient, but there is a
    small possibility that you will notice a difference.
