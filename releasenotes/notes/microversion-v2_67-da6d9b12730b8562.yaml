    Support is added for the `2.67 microversion`_ which allows specifying
    a ``volume_type`` with the ``--block-device`` option on the ``nova boot``
    command. The ``novaclient.v2.servers.ServerManager.create()`` method now
    also supports a ``volume_type`` entry in the ``block_device_mapping_v2``
    parameter.
