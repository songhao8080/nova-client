    The following CLIs and their backing API bindings were deprecated and
    capped at microversion 2.43:

    * ``nova host-describe`` - superseded by ``nova hypervisor-show``
    * ``nova host-list`` - superseded by ``nova hypervisor-list``
    * ``nova host-update`` - superseded by ``nova service-enable`` and
      ``nova service-disable``
    * ``nova host-action`` - no alternative by design

    The CLIs and API bindings have now been removed.
