deprecations:
  - |
    The os-cloudpipe API has been removed from Nova.  As a result, the
    ``nova cloudpipe-list``, ``nova cloudpipe-create``, and ``nova
    cloudpipe-configure`` commands and the ``novaclient.v2.cloudpipe``
    API bindings are now deprecated, and will be removed in the first
    major release after the Nova server 16.0.0 Pike release.
