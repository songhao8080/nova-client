    Adds support for microversion 2.62 which adds ``host`` (hostname)
    and ``hostId`` (an obfuscated hashed host id string) fields to the
    instance action ``GET /servers/{server_id}/os-instance-actions/{req_id}``
    API.

    The event columns are already included in the result of
    "nova instance-action <server> <request-id>" command, therefore does not
    have any CLI or python API binding impacts in the client.
