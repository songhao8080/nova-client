deprecations:
  - |
    ``novaclient.utils.add_resource_manager_extra_kwargs_hook`` and
    ``novaclient.utils.get_resource_manager_extra_kwargs`` were designed for
    supporting extensions in nova/novaclient. Nowadays, this "extensions"
    feature is abandoned and both ``add_resource_manager_extra_kwargs_hook``,
    ``add_resource_manager_extra_kwargs_hook`` are not used in novaclient's
    code. These methods are not documented, so we are removing them without
    standard deprecation cycle.
