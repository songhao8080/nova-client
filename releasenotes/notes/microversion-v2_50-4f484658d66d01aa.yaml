    Adds support for the ``2.50`` microversion which fixes the
    ``nova quota-class-show`` and ``nova quota-class-update`` commands in the
    following ways:

    * The ``server_groups`` and ``server_group_members`` quota resources will
      now be shown in the output table for ``nova quota-class-show``.
    * The ``floating_ips``, ``fixed_ips``, ``security_groups`` and
      ``security_group_rules`` quota resources will no longer be able to
      be updated using ``nova quota-class-update`` nor will they be shown in
      the output of ``nova quota-class-show``. Use python-openstackclient or
      python-neutronclient to work with quotas for network resources.

    In addition, the ``nova quota-class-update`` CLI was previously incorrectly
    limiting the ability to update quota class values for ``floating_ips``,
    ``fixed_ips``, ``security_groups`` and ``security_group_rules`` based on
    the 2.36 microversion. That has been changed to limit based on the ``2.50``
    microversion.
upgrade:
  - |
    The ``novaclient.v2.quota_classes.QuotaClassSetManager.update`` method
    now defines specific kwargs starting with microversion ``2.50`` since
    updating network-related resource quota class values is not supported on
    the server with microversion ``2.50``. The list of excluded resources is:

    - ``fixed_ips``
    - ``floating_ips``
    - ``networks``
    - ``security_groups``
    - ``security_group_rules``
