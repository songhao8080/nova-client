    Support is added for the 2.57 microversion:

    * A ``userdata`` keyword argument can be passed to the ``Server.rebuild``
      python API binding. If set to None, it will unset any existing userdata
      on the server.
    * The ``--user-data`` and ``--user-data-unset`` options are added to the
      ``nova rebuild`` CLI. The options are mutually exclusive. Specifying
      ``--user-data`` will overwrite the existing userdata in the server, and
      ``--user-data-unset`` will unset any existing userdata on the server.

      the output of the ``nova quota-show`` and ``nova quota-class-show``
      commands and related python API bindings.
