    Added support for `microversion 2.80`_ which adds ``user_id``
    and ``project_id`` filter parameters to the ``GET /os-migrations`` API.

    New kwargs ``project_id`` and ``user_id`` have been added to
    the following python API binding:

    - novaclient.v2.migrations.MigrationManager.list

    The following CLI changes have been made:

    - The ``--project-id`` and ``--user-id`` options are added to the
      ``nova migration-list`` CLI.
    - The ``nova server-migration-list`` and ``nova server-migration-show``
      commands will show the ``Project ID`` and ``User ID`` values when
      using microversion 2.80 or greater.
