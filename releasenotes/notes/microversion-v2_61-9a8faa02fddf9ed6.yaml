    Starting from microversion 2.61, the responses of the 'Flavor' APIs
    include the 'extra_specs' parameter. Therefore 'Flavors extra-specs'
    (os-extra_specs) API calls have been removed in the following commands
    since microversion 2.61.

    * ``nova flavor-list``
    * ``nova flavor-show``

    There are no behavior changes in the CLI. This is just a performance
    optimization.
