deprecations:
  - |
    The ``binary`` argument to the ``nova service-enable``,
    ``nova service-disable``, and ``nova service-force-down`` commands has been
    deprecated. The only binary that it makes sense to use is ``nova-compute``
    since disabling a service like ``nova-scheduler`` or ``nova-conductor``
    does not actually do anything, and starting in the 16.0.0 Pike release the
    compute API will not be able to look up services other than
    ``nova-compute`` for these operations.
