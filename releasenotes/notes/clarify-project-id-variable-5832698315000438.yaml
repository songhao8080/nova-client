deprecations:
  - Keyword argument **tenant_id** of novaclient.client.Client entry-point was
    deprecated in favor of **project_id**.
  - Keyword argument **tenant_name** of novaclient.client.Client entry-point
    was deprecated in favor of **project_name**.
other:
  - The meaning of 'project_id' variable of novaclient.client.Client
    entry-point was not clear. In different cases it was used as ID or Name of
    project (in terms of Keystone). The time to identify meaning is come, so
    now project_id/tenant_id variables specifically mean Project ID (in terms
    of Keystone) and project_name/tenant_name variables mean Project Name (in
    terms of Keystone).
