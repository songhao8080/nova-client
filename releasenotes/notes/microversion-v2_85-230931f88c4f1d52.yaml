    Support is added for compute API `microversion 2.85`_. This adds the
    ability to update an attached volume with a ``delete_on_termination``,
    which specify if the attached volume should be deleted when the server
    is destroyed.

    - The ``--delete-on-termination`` and ``--no-delete-on-termination``
      options are added to the ``nova volume-update`` CLI.
    - New kwarg called ``delete_on_termination`` added to the python API
      binding:

    - ``novaclient.v2.volumes.VolumeManager.update_server_volume()``
