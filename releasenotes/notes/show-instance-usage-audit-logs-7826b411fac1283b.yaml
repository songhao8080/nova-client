features:
  - Added new client API and CLI (``nova instance-usage-audit-log``)
    to get server usage audit logs.
    By default, it lists usage audits for all servers on all
    compute hosts where usage auditing is configured.
    If you specify the ``--before`` option, the result is filtered
    by the date and time before which to list server usage audits.
