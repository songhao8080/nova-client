deprecations:
  - CLI argument for volume_service_name was deprecated long time ago. All
    novaclient's methods for communication with Volume API were deprecated and
    removed. There is no need to leave **volume_service_name** argument of
    novaclient.client.Client entry-point since it is not used anywhere,
    so it is removed now.
