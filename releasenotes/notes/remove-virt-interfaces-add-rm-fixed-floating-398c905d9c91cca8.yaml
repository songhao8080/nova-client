    The following CLIs and their backing API bindings were deprecated and
    capped at microversion 2.44:

    * ``nova add-fixed-ip``: use python-neutronclient or openstacksdk
    * ``nova remove-fixed-ip``: use python-neutronclient or openstacksdk
    * ``nova floating-ip-associate``: use python-neutronclient or openstacksdk
    * ``nova floating-ip-disassociate``: use python-neutronclient or
      openstacksdk
    * ``nova virtual-interface-list``: there is no replacement as this is
      only implemented for nova-network which is deprecated

    The CLIs and API bindings have now been removed.
