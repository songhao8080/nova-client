    OSprofiler support was added to the client. That makes
    possible to trigger Nova operation trace generation from
    the CLI.
features:
  - A new ``--profile`` option was added to allow Nova
    profiling from the CLI. If the user wishes to trace a
    nova boot request he or she needs to type the following
    command -- ``nova --profile <secret_key> boot --image <image>
    --flavor <flavor> <vm_name>``, where ``secret_key`` should match one
    of the keys defined in nova.conf. As a result of this operation
    additional information regarding ``trace_id`` will be
    printed, that can be used to generate human-friendly
    html report -- ``osprofiler trace show --html <trace_id> --out
    trace.html``.
    To enable profiling, user needs to have osprofiler
    installed in the local environment via ``pip install osprofiler``.
security:
  - OSprofiler support, that was added during the Ocata release cycle,
    requires passing of trace information between various
    OpenStack services. This information is signed by one of
    the HMAC keys defined in nova.conf file. That means that
    only someone who knows this key is able to send the proper
    header to trigger profiling.
