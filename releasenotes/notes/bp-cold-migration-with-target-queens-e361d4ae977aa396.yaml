features:
  - Added a new ``--host`` option to ``nova migrate`` command
    in microversion 2.56. It enables administrators to specify
    a target host when cold migating a server. The target host will be
    validated by the scheduler. The target host cannot be the same as
    the current host on which the server is running and must be in the
    same cell that the server is currently in.
