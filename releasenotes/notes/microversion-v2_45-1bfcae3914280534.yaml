    Support was added for microversion 2.45. This changes how the
    ``createImage`` and ``createBackup`` server action APIs return
    the created snapshot image ID in the response. With microversion
    2.45 and later, the image ID is return in a json dict response body
    with an ``image_id`` key and uuid value. The old ``Location`` response
    header is no longer returned in microversion 2.45 or later.

    There are no changes to the ``nova image-create`` CLI. However, the
    ``nova backup`` CLI will print out the backup snapshot image information
    with microversion 2.45 or greater now.
