    The ``--migration-type`` and ``--source-compute`` options are added to the
    ``nova migration-list`` CLI and related kwargs are added to the
    ``novaclient.v2.migrations.MigrationManager.list`` method. These can be
    used to filter the list of migrations by type (evacuation, live-migration,
    migration, resize) and the name of the source compute service host involved
    in the migration.
