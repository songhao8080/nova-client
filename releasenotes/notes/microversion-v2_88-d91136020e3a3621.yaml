    Added support for `microversion 2.88`_. The
    ``novaclient.v2.hypervisors.HypervisorManager.uptime`` method will now
    transparently switch between the ``/os-hypervisors/{id}/uptime`` API,
    which is deprecated in 2.88, and the ``/os-hypervisors/{id}`` API, which
    now includes uptime information, based on the microversion.

    The ``nova hypervisor-stats`` command and underlying
    ``novaclient.v2.hypervisors.HypervisorStatsManager.statistics`` API are
    deprecated starting in microversion 2.88 and will return an error starting
    on this version.
