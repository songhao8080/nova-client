      The contents of the list_extensions.py file was moved from contrib to v2
      directory in release 7.0.0, and a stub importing the objects from the new
      location was left in its place for backward compatibility, together with
      a warning informing about the new location. However, the stub incorrectly
      assigned the ListExtResource class to the ListExtManager name. This has
      now been fixed, and ListExtManager is used instead.
