    Added support for `microversion 2.53`_. The following changes were made
    for the ``services`` commands and python API bindings:

    - The ``nova service-list`` command and API will have a UUID value for the
      ``id`` field in the output and response, respectively.
    - The ``nova service-enable`` command and API will require a UUID service
      id value to uniquely identify the service rather than a ``host`` and
      ``binary`` value. The UUID ``id`` field will also be in the command
      output.
    - The ``nova service-disable`` command and API will require a UUID service
      id value to uniquely identify the service rather than a ``host`` and
      ``binary`` value. The UUID ``id`` field will also be in the command
      output.
    - The ``nova service-force-down`` command and API will require a UUID
      service id value to uniquely identify the service rather than a ``host``
      and ``binary`` value. The UUID ``id`` field will also be in the command
      output.
    - The ``nova service-delete`` command and API will require a UUID
      service id value to uniquely identify the service rather than an integer
      service id value.

    The following changes were made for the ``hypervisors`` commands and python
    API bindings:

    - The ID field in the various ``nova hypervisor-*`` commands and
      ``Hypervisor.id`` attribute in the API binding will now be a UUID value.
    - If paging over hypervisors using ``nova hypervisor-list``, the
      ``--marker`` must be a UUID value.
    - The ``nova hypervisor-show`` and ``nova hypervisor-uptime`` commands and
      APIs now take a UUID value for the hypervisor ID.
