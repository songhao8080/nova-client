    Added support for `microversion 2.66`_ which adds ``changes-before``
    parameter to the servers, os-instance-actions or os-migrations APIs.

    * This parameter (``changes-before``) does not change any read-deleted
      behavior in the os-instance-actions or os-migrations APIs.
    * Like the ``changes-since`` filter, the ``changes-before`` filter will
      also return deleted servers.
    * The ``--changes-before`` options is added to the ``nova list``,
      ``nova instance-action-list`` and ``nova migration-list`` CLIs.
