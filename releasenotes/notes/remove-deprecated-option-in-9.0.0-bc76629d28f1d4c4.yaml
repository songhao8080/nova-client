upgrade:
  - |
    The following deprecated options have been removed:

    - ``--tenant`` (from ``flavor access list``)
    - ``--cell_name`` (from ``migration list``)
    - ``--volume-service-name`` (global option)

    As a result, the ``novaclient.v2.migrations.MigrationManager.list``
    python API binding method no longer takes a ``cell_name`` kwarg.
